# Home-Automation-
This is a smart home project where we control various devices automatically or remotely. The project aims to enhance convenience and efficiency by integrating technology into our daily lives. By automating tasks such as adjusting the lighting, temperature, and level of water in the tank, we can create a seamless and personalized living experience. In this project,we have an automatic light system where the bulb automatically turns on at night and off during the day. Additionally, the Blynk application allows users to monitor and adjust these settings remotely, providing convenience and flexibility. With this integration of technology, users can easily create a comfortable and efficient living environment without the need for manual adjustments.Â
